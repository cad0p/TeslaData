A year ago I happened to stumble on interesting data about Tesla vehicles consumption in relation to speed and temperature. I decided to reveal the data!

# Tesla Consumption Data based on Speed and Temperature

A matlab script to generate a cool graph to visualize and predict consumption data.

Based on this I created a calculator [on Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/nnccaofdub) to show the optimal cruising speed, interpolating data for higher speeds. (it's about 165 kph / 100 mph)

### Preview of the Desmos Calculator for optimal cruising speed:
